# Sequoia — an open source, 3U Imaging CubeSat
Sequoia is our current 3U CubeSat that will demonstrate on-board image classification and processing with updateable machine learning models. The goal of the project is to obtain open-source imagery and prove autonomous orbit determination. We will actively retrain Sequoia’s deep learning models using a three camera set-up. Our mission architecture is software-defined via image locations, types, and resolutions—Sequoia returns quality imagery. We are actively collaborating with IBM Space Tech. Please contact us about potential launch opportunities.
